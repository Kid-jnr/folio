          I'm Jay Aridndam Maity a curious mind who loves building things —
          whether it's with code, circuits, or even a simple recipe in the
          kitchen...
          <br /> <br />
          Professionally, I dive into programming with languages like C, C++,
          JavaScript, and Python, along with their ecosystems and frameworks.
          Whether it's creating web apps, tinkering with microcontrollers, or
          solving logic problems, I'm always up for a challenge...
          <br /> <br />
          When I'm not coding, you might find me:
          <ul>
            <li>Cooking something new 🍳</li>
            <li>
              Deep into a League of Legends match or exploring other games 🎮
            </li>
            <li>Reading a book or building an electronic gadget 📚🔧</li>
            <li>
              Or just helping someone out — because I believe a little help goes
              a long way 🤝
            </li>

            Why This Website?

            Few of you may question why this website was made in the first place...
            <br /> There is just so much stuff that might not be of use to anyone...
            Although that is true, I made this website to share little things I own and enjoy...
            This website will have tons of things that you can give a try (who knows you might end up liking them) XD.
